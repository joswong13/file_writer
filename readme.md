# File Writer

This bash script reads all the files in the same directory and writes it to a text file (text file name given by user).

# How to Use

Copy the 'file_writer.sh' to the top directory of the files you wish to record to a text file. Then double click, enter a name for the output file in the command prompt. Wait until the command prompt window closes which signifies the script has ended.

# Example output

./EXAMPLE/FILE1.TXT\
./EXAMPLE/INNER_FOLDER/PICTURE.JPG\
./EXAMPLE2/INNER_FOLDER2/DOC.TXT\
./EXAMPLE3/OUTTER_FOLDER/INNER_FOLDER3/TEST.TXT\
.DIRECTORY_FILE.PNG\
